kurwaCss is made in SASS, which makes it very dynamic to select the individual elements you might require for your project. Open the 'select_styles.scss' and comment the items you won't be needing, then compile a separate CSS document and pipe it into the 'lowlevel css/styles.css'.

I will get around and make a nice view and pick preivew page. Someday.. Probably. We'll see.

If you are unfamiliar with SASS, a document containing all styles are included in CSS format (all_styles.css).
